# Reflection Section
# What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?

# The first hash syntax uses a hash rocket (=>) with a string as key. The
# second syntax uses syntactic sugar to make the key a symbol with the : after
# the key name

# What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?

# require_relative allows you to load a file relative to the current file.
# require uses the current directory that the program is running in.

# What are some ways to iterate through a hash?

# One way to iterate over a hash is with #each and define the key and value in
# the argument block.

# When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?

# At first nothing, but with the help of our GPS we noticed that the methods in
# virus_effects were being called with instance variables as their arguments.
# Since instance variables are available throughout the whole class, there is no
# need to pass them as arguments to a method.


# What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?

# I think I had a breakthrough moment with identifying the scope of different
# variables. I also solidified my understanding of accessing values in a nested
# hash.
